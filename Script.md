## Synopsis

George discovers a hidden gate behind the zoo.
Behind it, he finds a magical world of unicorns living in perfect peace and harmony where he discovers the meaning of imagination.

## Plot

George woke to the sound of traffic, the sky was grey.
After his typical breakfast of toast and eggs he left for school.
Normally George would have walked down Bleaker Street, but today there was construction and he decided to take Flanders behind the zoo.

Being on time was not one of George’s specialities, and today would prove to be no different, as he moved slowly.
As he walked behind the zoo he could see the trees and thick foliage growing above the heavy stone wall that ran behind the zoo; and heard the sounds of animals in the distance.
George had heard the sound before, but today there was a new sound, sort of a cross between an angelic horn and an elephant’s trumpet.
He stopped to listen and noticed a heavy wooden door in the zoo wall was ajar.

Normally George would leave well enough alone, but he was worried that an animal might escape.
He stuck his head in the door, the colours of the foliage were intense greens, browns and chartreuse. He called out for a zoo keeper but got no response.
The smell of the of the zoo was intense and alive.
He took a tentative step through the door and followed the stone path overgrown with giant ferns.

Suddenly George heard a noise at his feet. A small mouse in an official-looking hat had appeared in front of him, and sprang back in alarm: "Don't step on me, boy!" it squeaked, "What are you doing in here anyway? This zoo is for animals."

"Who are you?" inquired George, wondering vaguely why this mouse could talk.

"I'm Braus the Mouse, Grand Zookeeper in da house!" said the mouse, in as grand a voice as it could muster. "What are you doing in here, uh, what was your name...?"

"I'm George, and the door was open."

No sooner had George uttered those words, than he was to set in motion an adventure which would make Curious George seem introverted, and Harry Potter's life seem boring. It was a caper so vast in scope, and with more important details than the number of ants on your weirdo cousin's ant farm, that the particulars of which are too numerous and weighty to deliver at this present moment. Suffice to say, that George's life was changed forever, and he was late for school, and he wsa even ready for second breakfast by the time he returned to the master branch of reality.

It was, also, the adventure at the end of which George met the Unicorn King, who granted him magic powers.
The end.
